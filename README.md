# USB relays

Control separately 16 signal relays through a PC by using a standard USB connection and a simple text-based serial protocol.  
Each relay can switch up to 3A at 24VDC (warning : this board is not designed for AC current).  
There is no need for a separate power supply to power the board, it is designed to be fully powered by the USB connection (that's why small relays are used).
